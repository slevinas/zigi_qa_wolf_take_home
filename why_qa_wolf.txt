Hi there,

I just recorded a Loom explaining my interest in working at QA, as well as a code challenge I tackled. In the video, I walk through the challenge of verifying the sorting of articles on a webpage. I shared my approach and solutions, including using Playwright for testing. You can check it out here:

Thanks!
